Scope of the project:

my first Neural Network project.
Let's start slow and implement feature by feature.

Things that need to be done:

- [ ] Get pokemon data
- [ ] Store the data
- [ ] label the data
- [ ] follow a NN guide for a basic CNN
- [ ] use new experience to start this project properly
- [ ] implement CNN for pokemon identification
- [ ] implement CNN for type recognition
- [ ] implement CNN for stats estimation
- [ ] research ways of name generation using images as base
- [ ] implement a NN that can give any image a pokemon name
- [ ] implement some sort of downsampling for input images so images of any size are acceptable rather than just sprites
- [ ] maybe at some point do evolutions somehow?
- [ ] shiny predictions would be cool after that as well
